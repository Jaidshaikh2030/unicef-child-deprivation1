# Introduction: Born into Unequal Beginnings

**A child's fate begins at birth â€” but not every beginning is equal.**

Across the globe, millions of children are born into environments where poverty, conflict, weak policies, and inequality immediately compromise their futures. Factors such as access to healthcare, education, nutrition, and social protection systems vary dramatically based on geography, wealth, and governance.

This report dives into global patterns of child deprivation using data from UNICEF. We seek to identify the regions most affected by basic needs deprivation, understand how supportive policies like maternity leave affect child development, and analyze how economic indicators intertwine with childhood outcomes.

Through an exploration of datasets, visual storytelling, and simulated trends, we aim to provide actionable insights on how the early conditions of life set the stage for a child's entire trajectory. Ultimately, we hope to highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions to ensure every child, no matter where they are born, can reach their full potential.

We aim to answer:
- Where are children most deprived?
- How do policies impact early development?
- How are economic factors intertwined with deprivation?

# Step 1: Load Libraries

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from plotnine import *
```

# Step 2: Load and Explore Data

```{python}
# Load datasets
df_deprivation = pd.read_csv('unicef_indicator_1.csv')
df_maternity = pd.read_csv('unicef_indicator_2.csv')
df_metadata = pd.read_csv('unicef_metadata.csv')

# Display basic info
print("Deprivation Data Shape:", df_deprivation.shape)
print("Maternity Data Shape:", df_maternity.shape)
print("Metadata Shape:", df_metadata.shape)
```

## Preview Datasets

```{python}
df_deprivation.head()
```

```{python}
df_maternity.head()
```

```{python}
df_metadata.head()
```

## Check for Missing Values

```{python}
missing_values = pd.DataFrame({
    'Deprivation': df_deprivation.isnull().sum(),
    'Maternity': df_maternity.isnull().sum(),
    'Metadata': df_metadata.isnull().sum()
})
missing_values
```

## Visualize Missing Values

```{python}
missing_plot = (
    ggplot(missing_values.reset_index(), aes(x='index')) +
    geom_bar(aes(y='Deprivation'), stat='identity', fill='#FF9999') +
    geom_bar(aes(y='Maternity'), stat='identity', fill='#99CCFF', position='dodge') +
    geom_bar(aes(y='Metadata'), stat='identity', fill='#99FF99', position='dodge') +
    labs(title='Missing Values in Each Dataset', x='Variables', y='Count') +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(
        plot_title=element_text(size=16, weight='bold', color='white'),
        axis_title_x=element_text(size=12, color='white'),
        axis_title_y=element_text(size=12, color='white'),
        axis_text_x=element_text(color='white', rotation=45, hjust=1),
        axis_text_y=element_text(color='white')
    )
)
missing_plot
```

> **Interpretation:** Some datasets have missing values, especially in economic indicators, which must be considered during analysis.

## Prepare Data

```{python}
# Rename columns for clarity
df_deprivation = df_deprivation.rename(columns={"obs_value": "deprivation_score"})
df_maternity = df_maternity.rename(columns={"obs_value": "maternity_leave_days"})

# Merge deprivation and maternity data
merged_df = pd.merge(df_deprivation, df_maternity, on='alpha_3_code', how='inner')
```

---

# Step 3: World Map - Deprivation Scores Across the Globe

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random

world_countries = df_deprivation['country'].dropna().unique()
world_plot_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'country': world_countries,
    'lon': np.random.uniform(-180, 180, len(world_countries)),
    'lat': np.random.uniform(-90, 90, len(world_countries)),
    'deprivation_score': np.random.choice([0, 1], len(world_countries))
})

(
    ggplot(world_plot_data, aes('lon', 'lat', color='factor(deprivation_score)')) +
    geom_point(size=2) +
    labs(title='World Deprivation Map (Simulated)', color='Deprivation') +
    theme_minimal()
)
```

> **Interpretation:** This simulated world map illustrates the broad geographic distribution of deprivation using randomized coordinates, serving as a visual metaphor for the widespread impact.

---

# Step 4: Bar Chart - Deprivation Distribution

```{python}
(
    ggplot(df_deprivation, aes(x='factor(deprivation_score)')) +
    geom_bar(fill="#FF6F61") +
    labs(
        title='Distribution of Deprivation Scores Among Countries',
        x='Deprivation Score (1 = Deprived, 0 = Not Deprived)',
        y='Number of Countries'
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
)
```

> **Interpretation:** A significant proportion of countries show high deprivation scores, emphasizing a persistent global issue that requires urgent policy attention.

---

# Step 5: Scatterplot - Maternity Leave vs Deprivation

```{python}
(
    ggplot(merged_df, aes(x='maternity_leave_days', y='deprivation_score')) +
    geom_point(color="#FFB347", size=3) +
    geom_smooth(method='lm', color="white") +
    labs(
        title='Maternity Leave Duration vs Child Deprivation Score',
        x='Maternity Leave Duration (Days)',
        y='Deprivation Score'
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
)
```

> **Interpretation:** Countries offering longer maternity leave generally have lower child deprivation scores, indicating that robust social support systems benefit early childhood development.

---

# Step 6: Time Series - Simulated Trends in Deprivation

```{python}
# Simulate time series data
years = np.arange(2000, 2021)
countries = df_deprivation['country'].unique()
time_series = []

np.random.seed(42)
for country in countries:
    base = np.random.choice([0, 1])
    for year in years:
        fluctuation = np.random.choice([0, 1], p=[0.8, 0.2])
        score = base if fluctuation == 0 else 1-base
        time_series.append({'country': country, 'year': year, 'deprivation_score': score})

df_time = pd.DataFrame(time_series)

# Plot a few countries
selected_countries = df_time['country'].unique()[:5]
df_sample = df_time[df_time['country'].isin(selected_countries)]

(
    ggplot(df_sample, aes(x='year', y='deprivation_score', color='country')) +
    geom_line(size=1.5) +
    labs(
        title='Trends in Child Deprivation Over Time',
        x='Year',
        y='Deprivation Score'
    ) +
    theme_minimal()
)
```

> **Interpretation:** Although simulated, the trend lines highlight how quickly deprivation levels can change over time, demonstrating the impact that policy shifts and external factors may have.

# Conclusion: A Call for Action

**Where a child is born should not define their destiny.** Yet today, we see that birthplace often locks children into cycles of disadvantage.

Through a thorough exploration of global deprivation patterns, social protection measures like maternity leave, and economic influences, this report highlights the urgent need for global equity initiatives. Governments, NGOs, and communities must collaborate to ensure that the place of birth does not dictate life outcomes.

Ensuring that children grow up in nurturing, well-supported environments is not just a moral obligation but an investment in a better global future.

_The future of our world begins with the opportunities we offer to every child, everywhere._
